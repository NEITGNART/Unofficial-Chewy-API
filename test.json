Whether it’s accompanying you on a brisk jog to help you stay in shape, or giving you a cuddle when you need it most, there’s no denying how rewarding a pup can be. Show your appreciation and reward your furry friend with the foods and treats they crave. \r\n\r\nChewy carries a wide range of delicious dog foods and tasty treats for your precious pup. When it comes to choosing a dog food, you may find all the options overwhelming. Let us help you find the best one with dog food reviews, ingredient information, and personal one-on-one attention when you give us a call at 1-800-672-4399. At Chewy we understand the important role dog food plays. Most of the nutrients your dog needs to stay strong and healthy comes from the food they eat. Chewy carries healthy dog food brands like Blue Buffalo, Royal Canin and Hill’s Prescription Diet. We even carry grain-free and limited ingredient diet dog foods for pups with food allergies or sensitivities. \r\n\r\nDry dog food is great for the pup parent who is away all day. Dry dog kibble can be left out for your canine companion to snack on throughout the day without spoiling. Dry kibble can also be good for your dog’s teeth -crunchy kibble helps pups get rid of pesky plaque and tartar. Wet dog food often contains flavors and ingredients canines love. Freeze-dried dog food is another option, the limited ingredients in freeze-dried dog food varieties makes it great for pups with sensitive stomachs or food allergies. And you may also consider feeding your pup dehydrated dog food. Dehydrated dog food is created by taking the whole foods found in a raw doggie diet, and slowly heating them until they’re dehydrated. An added bonus: Dehydrated dog food is easy to transport for pup parents who are on the go. And, raw and frozen dog food is another great option. These doggie meals offer your pet the nutrition he was meant to consume in the wild and are rich in protein and typically contain less additives. Whether it’s dry kibble your dog desires or a grain-free wet meal your canine craves, you can find the best dog food brands on Chewy to please his palate and his nutritional needs.",

Dog crates give your pet a place for himself where he can retreat to and feel safe and comforted. Whether it be for when you’re away from home, or just a place to sleep, dog kennels give your dog a safe space of his own. By starting crate training early on, your dog will learn to enjoy his time in a crate without feeling distressed or panicked. Chewy offers a variety of crate mats that allow your dog to be more comfortable and make his cage feel homier. For some dogs, pens may be used as an alternative to crates, or can be used as a supervised play area. Whether used indoors or outdoors, dog pens create a fenced in area for play without the tight confinement of a cage. If you have an area of your home that your pet should not be visiting and you would like to restrict access from, maybe an in-home gate would be right for you! Our range of gates allows you to choose a design that will match your home’s décor and fit your needs.",

[Dog crates & kennels](https://www.chewy.com/b/crates-kennels-369) give your pet a place for himself where he can retreat to and feel safe and comforted. Whether it be [wire dog crates](https://www.chewy.com/b/wire-crates-2727), [plastic dog crates](https://www.chewy.com/b/plastic-crates-kennels-2730) or [dog houses](https://www.chewy.com/b/dog-houses-2044), give your dog a safe space to call his own. By starting crate training early on, your dog will learn to enjoy his time in a crate without feeling distressed or panicked. \n\nChewy offers a variety of [dog crate mats](https://www.chewy.com/b/crate-mats-pads-367) that allow your dog to be more comfortable and make his cage feel homier. For some dogs, dog pens may be used as an alternative to crates, or can be used as a supervised play area. Whether used indoors or outdoors, [dog pens](https://www.chewy.com/b/pens-accessories-1468) create a fenced-in area for play without the tight confinement of a cage. If you have an area of your home that your pet should not be visiting and you would like to restrict access from, maybe an in-home [dog gate](https://www.chewy.com/b/gates-1465) would be right for you! Our range of gates and [dog doors](https://www.chewy.com/b/doors-2685) allows you to choose a design that will match your home’s décor and fit your needs. \n\nAnd for those puppy parents who are on the go be sure to check out the [dog travel aids](https://www.chewy.com/b/travel-aids-1471) and [dog travel bowls](https://www.chewy.com/b/travel-bowls-2785) which certainly make traveling with your pup easier than ever. So, whether you need some new [dog toys](https://www.chewy.com/b/toys-315), [dog stair](https://www.chewy.com/b/steps-ramps-449), or another bag of [dry dog food](https://www.chewy.com/b/dry-food-294), Chewy's online [pet store](https://www.chewy.com/) is sure to have great deals on all of the best [dog supplies](https://www.chewy.com/b/dog-288)!\n\nRelated Puppy Categories: [Best Extra Large Breed Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/extra-large-breed-puppy-crates_s130884), [Best Extra Small Breed Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/extra-small-breed-puppy-crates_s130972), [Best French Bulldog Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/french-bulldog-puppy-crates-pens_s131060), [Best German Shepherd Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/german-shepherd-puppy-crates_s131148), [Best Giant Breed Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/giant-breed-puppy-crates-pens_s131236), [Best Golden Retriever Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/golden-retriever-puppy-crates_s130796), [Best Goldendoodle Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/goldendoodle-puppy-crates-pens_s131324), [Best Labrador Retriever Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/labrador-retriever-puppy-crates_s131412), [Best Large Breed Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/large-breed-puppy-crates-pens_s131500), [Best Medium Breed Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/medium-breed-puppy-crates-pens_s131588), [Best Small Breed Puppy Crates, Pens & Gates](https://www.chewy.com/best/small-breed-puppy-crates-pens_s131676)",

                        "longDescription": "If you're looking for the perfect bed for your pooch, you've come to the right place. We have large dog beds, [small dog beds](https://www.chewy.com/f/extra-small-toy-breeds-dog-beds_c365_f6v13789), [waterproof dog beds](https://www.chewy.com/better-world-pets-waterproof-memory/dp/153706), washable dog beds - every kind of dog bed you might be looking for. There are some basic categories of dog beds, each with its own benefits. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nThe standard dog beds many pet parents look to first are [dog pillow beds](https://www.chewy.com/b/pillow-beds-1457). These are essentially large pillows that add increased comfort over what a hard floor offers. Some are flat while others are made with bolsters - raised sides that add a dimension of cuddling comfort to your pup's nap time. [Elevated dog beds](https://www.chewy.com/b/elevated-cooling-beds-1459) are another popular style pets and pet parents love. They feature a metal frame with a cot-style design. These beds don't have pressure points like some other beds, making them extremely comfortable for your dog. And they're exceptionally great for dogs with hip or joint issues, or breeds prone to getting them. Since they're elevated, they allow air to flow beneath, which help keep your dog cooler -  which can be great for thick-coated dogs. And they're perfect for use indoors and outside. [Orthopedic dog beds](https://www.chewy.com/b/orthopedic-beds-1460) are the perfect option for older dogs with hip, joint, bone and mobility issues as well as dog breeds that tend to experience these kinds of health issues. They feature super soft, pressure-relieving padding and as with pillow beds, orthopedic dog beds are available either flat or with bolsters for an added dimension of comfort and security.\n\nIf you live in a drafty home or are looking for an outdoor bed for cooler days, [heated dog beds](https://www.chewy.com/b/heated-beds-1458) are your best bet. They will ensure your best friend stays warm and comfy in any condition. There are a few different methods for heating these beds that you'll want to consider when choosing one. The most popular style plugs into your electrical outlet and has a heating element that keeps the bed at a constant temperature.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a bed to put in your [dog crate](https://www.chewy.com/b/crates-accessories-369), [dog carrier](https://www.chewy.com/b/carriers-366) take a look at [dog crate mats](https://www.chewy.com/b/crate-mats-pads-367). Specifically made for pet enclosures. They're shaped and sized to fit perfectly, with many featuring non-slip bottom coatings to keep them in place. And they're available in a variety of styles with different materials to fit your dog's needs. No matter your pet's preference or needs, keep him comfy and cozy with a dog bed especially made with him in mind.

Let’s take a look at how you dog can get fleas and ticks and, more importantly, how you can prevent and get rid of them with safe, yet powerful, tick and flea treatment products.\r\n\r\nYour dog can pick up fleas and ticks from other pets, from wildlife like squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, deer or opossums, and from nature, generally tall grasses or bushes. When a female flea or tick living on an animal lays her eggs, they fall off onto the ground. When those eggs hatch and the larvae grow into adult fleas and ticks, they hop onto a host. And if pets cross their path, it will be them. After a dog becomes a tick or flea host, they can suffer some health risks, ranging from minor irritations to potentially deadly diseases.\r\n\r\nWhen fleas bite a dog, their saliva leaves the skin irritated, leading to your dog itching and biting at the location. The irritation is uncomfortable to your dog and could even lead to her scratching to the point of fur loss. Fleas can also transmit tapeworms to your dog. Tapeworms are parasites that will live in your dog’s gut, leaching important nutrition from your dog’s diet. And then there’s ticks. When they latch onto a dog they can transmit a range of diseases—Lyme disease, rocky mountain spotted fever, tularemia and more. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to getting rid of fleas and ticks, you have options. There are spot treatment solutions, collars, oral treatments, shampoos, sprays and wipes for your pet, as well as spray treatments and foggers for around your home and yard. It’s important to treat your home, yard and pet if you want to end an infestation for good. If your pet already has fleas or ticks, look for a solution that kills fleas and ticks at both the adult life stage and the larvae stage. This is important, because if your pet has fleas or ticks, there’s a good chance larvae are hiding in carpets, furniture, your lawn and even in your pet’s fur. Following the manufacturer’s guidelines for use and application will ensure your tick and flea treatment is swift and absolute. If you’d prefer to avoid these headaches all together, take some preventative measures before your dog even becomes a flea or tick host, like with topical or oral preventatives or with a dog flea and tick collar. You can find everything you need right here on Chewy, so take the necessary precautions to protect your pet today.",

Flea shampoos and fast-acting chemical treatments kill fleas and ticks on contact but won’t prevent re-infestation. Topical and oral flea and tick treatments work by spreading over your pet’s skin and killing fleas and ticks on contact for up to a month. Many also include hormone growth regulators that prevent flea eggs and larvae from hatching and developing. These tend to be more effective long-term because they break the flea lifecycle and prevent parasite re-infestation.",

For heavy infestations, multiple methods may work best initially to get the situation under control. Washing pet bedding, vacuuming, treating the home and yard and flea shampooing your pet may be recommended before beginning a topical, collar or oral flea prevention regimen. Your vet can give you guidance and recommend the best flea and tick treatment and prevention products for your situation.",

Younger or ailing pets may not be able to use topicals or oral flea and tick meds, and those with heavy infestations may require multiple measures to get the problem under control. Vets sometimes recommend flea shampoos, yard and home flea treatments, or flea combing for pet flea and tick control.

Measure neck girth by positioning a tape measure around your dog’s neck right where he would wear a collar, remembering to leave it loose enough that you can fit two fingers under the tape. Do the same thing around the largest part of the chest, usually right behind the front legs, using the two finger rule as before. The topline measurement is the length from the base of the neck to where the tail begins. Always size up if your dog is in between sizes, and make sure any clothing is neither too tight nor too loose.",

Get ready and make sure you have a packing checklist that includes all your dog's gear, too. Some of the essential dog travel accessories are dog car seats, [dog car seat covers](https://www.chewy.com/f/canvas-car-accessories-dogs_c1469_f7v68552), [dog travel kennels](https://www.chewy.com/b/carriers-366), [dog ramps](https://www.chewy.com/b/steps-ramps-1635) and [travel bowls for pet food](https://www.chewy.com/b/travel-bowls-bags-1472).\n\nGive your pup her own special spot in the car with a dog car seat. These booster seats look like little baskets, and they lift your dog up for a nice view of the scenery. They're made to fit perfectly in the front or back seat. An interior [dog safety belt](https://www.chewy.com/dogit-car-safety-dog-belt/dp/50603) keeps pets tethered to the inside of the dog car seat, where your pup can settle in for a nap or keep her eye on the road. At Chewy, you'll find several of the best dog car seats from trusted brands like [K&H Pet Products](https://www.chewy.com/f/kh-pet-products_f1v118824), [Solvit](https://www.chewy.com/f/solvit_f1v554805), [Outward Hound](https://www.chewy.com/f/outward-hound_f1v850302), [Pet Gear](https://www.chewy.com/f/pet-gear_f1v361956), [American Kennel Club](https://www.chewy.com/f/american-kennel-club_f1v388472) and [Kurgo](https://www.chewy.com/f/kurgo_f1v499664). If you prefer to let your dog have full access to the back seat, but you don't want it getting dirty, try one of our [dog car seat covers](https://www.chewy.com/f/canvas-car-accessories-dogs_c1469_f7v68552). These protective covers span the back seat from window to window, and there are also some that are made for the cargo area. They wipe clean easily, or you can clean them in the washer. Durable and comfortable, these dog car seat covers keep your car free of pet hair, dirt and wetness.\n\nWhen it comes to pet travel, you should have a [sturdy travel kennel](https://www.chewy.com/b/carriers-366), whether you're traveling by car or plane. You might need to transport your pet from the car to the hotel, or take her along with you at a rest stop. A travel kennel is also good for snoozing in the car or keeping your dog secure during a flight. Look for one that is durable yet comfortable with plenty of room and adequate ventilation. You can choose between hard or [soft travel kennels](https://www.chewy.com/f/mesh-dog-carriers_c366_f7v265760) in all different styles and sizes. Some other dog travel accessories to consider are [dog ramps for senior pets](https://www.chewy.com/b/steps-ramps-1635), travel water and food dishes, and calming aids for furry travel mates that tend to get anxious in moving vehicles.

                "longDescription": "If we could, we’d choose to spend much more time with our pets—especially when they give us that look any time we have to leave the house. But we can’t always be there to keep an eye on them 24/7, or even to let them in and out the pet door in the middle of the night when they feel like going on an adventure. That’s where our pet tech products come in. So when you’re shopping for your monthly pet supplies, take a look at our pet tech gear. You’ll find efficient cat and dog monitors, including our best pet cameras, GPS dog collars and cat trackers. When you can’t be at home during the day, our automatic pet food dispensers make sure your pets are taken care of—sometimes through the touch of a button in a pet feeding app. And with electronic pet doors, they can come and go as they need. We’ve got pretty much everything you’d need to give your pets the most freedom while still keeping tabs on them and making sure they’re safe and well-fed.\r\n\r\nPet cameras are great for watching over all the pets in your household while you’re at work, or even just out running errands. Cat and dog webcams don’t just let you watch, but you can also interact with your furry friends with special features like two-way audio and Wi-Fi dog treat dispensers. For pets that have full range of the backyard, you can set up an electronic pet door that syncs with a device on their collars and stays locked when not in use. As soon as they’re out the door, a handy cat GPS or dog GPS system lets you know their whereabouts so they won’t stray too far. \r\n\r\nDiscover these helpful pet tech devices at Chewy—you’ll find the perfect solution for taking care of your pets even when you’re not at home.",

You’ve cared for them as part of your extended family, and they’ve given you unconditional love and devotion. And whether you’ve known a pet since puppyhood or for just their senior years, you’ve probably shared more than a few happy and unforgettable moments. So of course you want to hang on to those cherished memories and keep them close to your heart. We understand that feeling, because we’re pet lovers, too. There are many ways to remember your pets and to celebrate their impact on your life, and some pet owners decide to commemorate their special furry family members with keepsakes like dog memorial stones, pet headstones, pet cremation jewelry or even urns for pets. And if you know someone who’s lost a pet, they might enjoy a thoughtful pet memorial gift like pet memorial plaques or special dog keepsakes. \r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at some of the options for preserving all the fun times you’ve had with your pooch. Some pet keepsakes have room for your favorite photo of your pet with an opening to display her collar, too. There are pet memorials that have inspirational sayings or poems around the frame, and others that feature your dog’s picture next to an imprint of her paw print. You can also opt for pet memorial jewelry like necklaces, lockets or pendants with a pet photo, and some of these double as dog urns that safely store your pet’s ashes. Another nice way to pay tribute to your loved one is with pet memorial stones or pet grave markers. They’re made of weatherproof materials like resin or natural stone with a thoughtful epitaph, and you can display them inside, use them as pet gravestones, or place them on a pathway outside or in your pet’s favorite place.\r\n\r\nNo matter which way you decide to honor your loving pet, Chewy’s here to help with beautiful and commemorative pet memorial stones, dog urns, pet cremation jewelry and dog memorial plaques.",
